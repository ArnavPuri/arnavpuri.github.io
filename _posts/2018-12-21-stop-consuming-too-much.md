- ### Stop consuming too much caffeine.
- ### Stop consuming too much fat.
- ### Stop consuming too much sugar.
- ### Stop consuming too much alcohol.
- ### Stop consuming too much CONTENT!

I am the kind of person who keeps on looking for inspirational content. Whether it is a Youtube video, a listicle on top 10 habits, or a Ted talk, I thoroughly enjoy getting "motivated". 

But motivation is of no use if it is not followed by action. I believe we are our habits and not goals. With help of correct daily habits, we can achieve any goal we want. So I am cutting down on consuming content whether it is Netflix, Medium, Twitter or Youtube. Instead, I will be limiting them to a fixed time slot of the day.

I have found myself reading a lot of content on meditation but haven't tried it. It is surprising that I know 3 types of Indian meditation techniques thoroughly but too lazy (or ignorant) to try them. But no more, tomorrow morning I will be trying my first meditation (will share the experience too)

I believe this will help me go through the day more productively and effectively. This is another change I am making in order to enter 2019 with momentum.
